# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the necessary programming language and framework installed on your machine (e.g., Node.js, Python).
- Have access to a CI/CD tool of your choice (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

## Installation
1. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd ci-testing-automation
   ```
2. Install the dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   npm install  # for Node.js project
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # for Python project
   ```
3. Configure your CI environment by editing the configuration files in the `config/` directory based on your needs.
4. Run setup scripts if available to initialize your CI/CD tool.

## Verification
To verify the installation, run the following command:
```bash
npm run test  # for Node.js project
python -m unittest discover  # for Python project
```

If tests pass, your setup is complete!
